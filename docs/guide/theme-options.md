# Theme Decision

The docs UI is now finalized on the `circuit` palette.

## Selected direction

`circuit` is now the single active theme for the documentation site.

Why this direction:

- Strong technical look without relying on generic web palette defaults
- Better readability for long-form docs
- Stable light/dark parity for nav, cards, code blocks, and tables

## Scope for now

Color exploration is closed for this phase.

When feature scope is complete, we can revisit:

- section-level visual accents
- iconography refinements
- motion polish

## Preview

Run locally:

```bash
npx -y vitepress@1.6.4 dev docs --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173
```

Then open:

- [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173)
