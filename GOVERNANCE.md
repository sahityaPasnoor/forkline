# Governance

## Project Model

Forkline is currently maintained under a maintainer-led model.

Maintainers are responsible for:

- roadmap and release decisions
- reviewing and merging pull requests
- security triage and incident response
- enforcing project standards and Code of Conduct

## Decision Process

- Small changes are decided in pull request review.
- Breaking changes should be proposed in an issue first.
- Security-sensitive decisions follow `SECURITY.md`.

When there are competing approaches, maintainers prioritize:

1. user safety and security
2. terminal fidelity and correctness
3. backward compatibility where practical
4. long-term maintainability

## Maintainers

- reliability in production-impacting work
